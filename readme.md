#### TLDR

Using design methods and researching on tele-health solutions for international MS students, I developed the prototype of an online platform satisfying their core needs and desires. The project consisted of 4 phases (building empathy, defining the challenge, ideating/prototyping and delivering leading ideas) summary of which are presented below.

#### Key take-aways from the project

Throughout this project I understood the importance of thick data and design thinking in to empathize with the end user and develop innovative, solid and well targeted business solutions, creating a complete experience for the end user.

## Project Phases

### Phase I : Building Empathy - Immerse & Plan Research\
In this phase I explored the persona identified for the project. In this diverging phase, I tried to identify the thoughts and ideas of my persona related to the contexts in consideration, using immersive tools to gather deeper insights and underlying needs.

#### The Persona

- International Student
- Just moved in the United States
- Plans to stay
- 10 month rigorous educational program

#### Big Research Questions
- What is our persona\'92s perspective of health?
- What kind of health care services they prefer?
- What health-related difficulties do they face? 

### Phase II : Defining the challenge
In this phase, using specialized developed tools and after conducting an in-depth analysis of insights key findings were organized and initial conclusions were made based on the same.

#### Key insights

- Health perspective

The participants did not consider themselves spiritual, valued their mental health in regards to stress management above all and considered fitness is an important aspect of their physical health and valued their social relationships wanting to be well received.

- Major Pain Points

Stress - Specialization/personalization - Lack of information - Inadequate communication - Cost

- The challenge

How might we develop a cost effective remote service solution for international students who just moved in the States pursuing an intensive and stressful curriculum and lack information about local healthcare, to make it easy for them to get health care services equivalent to what they had in their countries in regards to the communication, effectiveness and familiarity level?


### Phase III : Ideating, prototyping & testing

In this phase focus was given on developing a number of different solution ideas and then creating rough, rapid prototypes to visually/physically represent two or three of the leading ideas, while using those prototypes to gather feedback from end users.

#### Prototypes

- Doctor/patient application
- Medicine availability platform
- Online medical forum

#### Final Prototype
Based on these prototypes and after testing them and revising them, a complete solution was developed, incorporating multiple features, allowing for users to connect with doctors and schedule appointments online. Providing them with easy access to healthcare and multiple options based on which they would satisfy their personal needs. The app was rapidly designed in regards to the wanted features and tested once more, in two different test users who helped in its refinement and even more specialization.


### Phase IV : Present leading ideas

Based on the refined prototype, a realistic prototype was developed considering the various forms and modes of interaction. The project was presented in a coherent and cohesive final presentation, including the addition of information associated with the final product/service prototype including information that is relevant from the previous phases as well as any additional information that helped the overall understanding and also providing critiques on the ideas.
